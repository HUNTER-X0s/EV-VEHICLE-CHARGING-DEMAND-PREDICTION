# EV-VEHICLE-CHARGING-DEMAND-PREDICTION

AICTE INTERNSHIP CYCLE - 2

ðŸ”‹ EV Vehicle / Charging Demand Prediction
Forecasting electric vehicle adoption across counties using machine learning, with a scalable and interactive dashboard to support infrastructure planning.


ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project addresses a critical need in sustainable mobility: forecasting the future demand for electric vehicles (EVs) to assist in charging station planning and infrastructure investment. Using real-world county-wise data from Washington State, the project:

Analyzes historical EV adoption patterns,

Builds predictive models using machine learning,

And deploys an interactive Streamlit dashboard to visualize results.

ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
The rapid growth of EVs is outpacing the readiness of infrastructure. Decision-makers often underestimate or overestimate demand, leading to:

Charging station shortages or congestion, or

Wasted investments in under-utilized infrastructure.

This project provides an AI-powered solution to forecast EV growth and guide data-driven decision-making.

ðŸš€ Project Goals
ðŸ“ˆ Understand EV adoption trends by county

ðŸ¤– Train machine learning models for accurate forecasting

ðŸ“Š Visualize 3-year forecasts in an interactive dashboard

ðŸ§  Empower stakeholders to optimize infrastructure planning

ðŸ§  Methodology
Data Collection

County-level EV population dataset from Washington State.

Data Preprocessing

Cleaned dates, handled duplicates, and encoded categorical variables.

Feature Engineering

Added lag features, rolling averages, percentage change, and growth slope metrics.

Model Training

Built a regression forecasting model using Scikit-learn, saved as forecasting_ev_model.pkl.

Forecasting

Generated 36-month predictions for EV adoption per county.

Visualization

Created a Streamlit dashboard for user interaction and visual comparison between counties.
